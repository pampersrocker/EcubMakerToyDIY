Settings for the EcubMakerToyDIY (tested on Cura 4.4.1)

The settings and profiles found in this repository are extracted from the generated gcode files of the EcubWare cura clone. They have been fixed and modified to operate more efficiently. Use at your own risk.

Things to keep in mind:

* Ensure Fan Speed is set to 100% at all times as there is only a single fan for colling and part cooling, so if the fan is turned off, the printer head will no longer be sufficiently cooled.
* Dual FDM printing is currently extremely slow and broken as a filament change takes about a minute and will cause oozing when returning from the sidebay.
